# Credit-Card-Launch_Analysis

This project contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook, where we perform detailed inspection, visualization, and initial insights into the dataset.

## 📄 About the Notebook

The notebook walks through the important EDA steps:
- Data Loading
- Initial Inspection (shape, info, null values)
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Outlier Detection
- Correlation Analysis
- Visualizations (like heatmaps, histograms, boxplots)
- Basic Data Cleaning

The goal is to **understand the structure, patterns, and relationships in the data** before moving toward modeling.
